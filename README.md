Welcome to the source code for my online portfolio, angusdumaresq.com. 

# About This Project
This project draws inspiration from the captivating single-page portfolios celebrated on platforms like awwwards.com and cssdesignawards.com. While acknowledging that my portfolio is currently a humble distance away from these masterpieces, the sheer beauty and creativity displayed on those sites are inspiring the journey for this project.

As I continue to grow my expertise in JavaScript and CSS, this portfolio will undergo iterative enhancements. The ultimate ambition is to birth something not just unique, but downright outlandish â€” crafted to awe and inspire.

# Key Features
**Responsive Design:** Designed to be scalable and accessible across various devices and screen sizes

**About Me:** Showcases a bit about me, my education, skills and my career aspirations

**Skillset Display:** Uses React hooks such as useEffect and useRef to trigger Javascript functions to make the site responsive

# Future Plans
**Beautify:** Make the site more 'artsy' through colours and images 

**Interactive Experiences:** Incorporate interactive elements to make the portfolio more dynamic

**Database:** Integrate the site with a SQL database using Node.js
